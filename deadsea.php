                        <p class="text-justify">This area is a unique Geographical phenomenon, a salty lake in the middle of the “African-Syrian Breakage” and it is the lowest point on earth – 390 meters below the sea level at 418 meters (1,371 ft) below sea level and falling, and the deepest hyper saline lake in the world at 330 m (1,083 ft) deep and 799 m (2,621 ft) below sea level.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The superior quality of the water from the Dead Sea, results from an extremely high contents of salt. It is one of the saltiest bodies of water on Earth with a salinity of about 30%. This is about 8.6 times greater than the average ocean salinity. It measures 67 kilometers (42 mi) long, up to 18 kilometers (11 mi) wide, and is located on the border between Israel and Jordan. </p>

The heat favors the constant evaporation of the sea water and enriches the air with magnesium and bromine. This also contributes to the relaxing effects of a therapeutic stay there and diminishes stress. The air is dry; the rainy season is very short. Thus, the air contains no allergens or pollution. These conditions are ideal for patients suffering from asthma or chronic obstructive bronco-pathologies.</p>
